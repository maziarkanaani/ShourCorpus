# ShourCorpus [1]
non-metric symbolic Iranian classical music corpus

### Overview
**ShourCorpus** is an open-source symbolic dataset focused on non-metric Iranian classical music, specifically the Dastgah Shour from Radif Mirza Abdollah. This corpus includes 29 MIDI files and data sheets that represent the foundational repertoire of Iranian classical music based on  “Radif Analysis - based on the notation of Mirza Abdollah’s Radif with annotated visual description” by Dariush Talai [2]. It is intended for use in computational musicology research, algorithmic music analysis, music information retrieval and educational purposes.

### Contents
- **MIDI Files**: MIDI files for each Gusheh in the Dastgah Shour.
- **Data Sheets**: Detailed data sheets for each piece, including note names, durations, MIDI note numbers, intervals, and pitch bending.
- **Research Papers**: Relevant research papers and documentation on the methodologies used in the creation and analysis of the corpus.

### Features
- **Non-Metric Rhythm**: Unlike Western music, the pieces in this corpus do not follow bar-centric organization.
- **Micro-Tonal Pitch**: Represents the unique micro-tonal adjustments specific to Iranian classical music.
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Detailed hierarchical structure for each Gusheh.
  
### Usage
This repository is aimed at computer scientists, researchers, musicians, and educators interested in Iranian classical music. It provides a dataset for studying the modal systems, melodic structures, and rhythmic patterns unique to this tradition.

### License
This project is open-source and allows for free use of the dataset. 

### Funding
This work was conducted with the financial support of the Science Foundation Ireland Centre for Research Training in Digitally-Enhanced Reality (d-real) under Grant No. 18/CRT/6224.
